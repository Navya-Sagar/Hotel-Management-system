# Hotel-Management-system
Explore Inn is a user-friendly web application designed to help users search for hotels, view detailed information, and share their experiences through reviews.

Travelers can browse hotels, check out amenities, and share feedback on their stay to help others make informed decisions.

User Reviews: Post reviews with images and comments to help others find the best accommodations.
